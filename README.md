# SURF1-test
just a test for my surf opencv

Hi, yang...

emmmm.....
Today, I've tried the OPenCV SURF.
It's hard for me to write it with C++.
So, I read some documents on OPenCV's web and it showed me some code on github, that's why I'm here.
I'll try my best to understand the stitching method.

Though I've signed up Github since 2017, but this is the first time I've understand it! Congratulations!
Ok, best wishes to myself.
